               <span>
                Have you ever heard about sea shanties?<br> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(Sea shanties are traditional work songs that were commonly sung by sailors and seafarers during the 19th century and earlier. These songs were an integral part of maritime culture and were used to coordinate tasks and provide rhythm for various activities on ships. Sea shanties were particularly important during tasks that required teamwork and synchronization, such as hauling ropes, raising sails, and turning capstans.)</span>

           </h1>
           <h1 style="top: 600px;">There once was a ship that put to sea <br>
            The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea <br>
            The winds blew up, her bow dipped down <br>
            Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br>
            One day, when the tonguing is done <br>
            We'll take our leave and go <br>
             <br>
            She'd not been two weeks from shore <br>
            When down on her a right whale bore <br>
            The captain called all hands and swore <br>
            He'd take that whale in tow (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br>
            One day, when the tonguing is done <br>
            We'll take our leave and go <br>
             <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br>
             <br>
            Before the boat had hit the water <br>
            The whale's tail came up and caught her <br>
            All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her <br>
            When she dived down low (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br>
            One day, when the tonguing is done <br>
            We'll take our leave and go <br>
             <br>
            No line was cut, no whale was freed <br>
            The captain's mind was not of greed <br>
            And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed <br>
            She took that ship in tow (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br>
            One day, when the tonguing is done <br>
            We'll take our leave and go <br>
             <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br>
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da <br>
             <br>
            For forty days or even more <br>
            The line went slack then tight once more <br>
            All boats were lost, there were only four <br>
            But still that whale did go (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
            To bring us sugar and tea and rum <br>
            One day, when the tonguing is done <br>
            We'll take our leave and go <br>
             <br>
            As far as I've heard, the fight's still on <br>
            The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone <br>
            The Wellerman makes his regular call <br>
            To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh) <br>
             <br>
            Soon may the Wellerman come <br>
